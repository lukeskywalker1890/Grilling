# Grilling

#This program is a grilling program that uses voice recognition to search the linked list for the cut of beef the user said.

#To make this application work you need to record your self asking the three questions and put them in the audio folder.
#Make sure to label the files the same as the ones that are being used in the playsound functions.
#Each question you are recording should be the playsound file labeled under the printed text question.
